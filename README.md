In this repository, the practical case for the Biometrics Case Study is implemented. 


## Acknowledgements
The methods implemented were adapted from the following papers:

 - [Fast Retinal Vessel Detection and Measurement Using Wavelets and Edge Location Refinement](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032435)
 - [Usefulness of Retina Codes in Biometrics](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-92957-4_54)

 The Crossing Number implementation used was the one made by cuevas1208.

 Finally, the data used was taken from RIDB dataset.
